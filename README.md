## l2_afp: L2 Alternate "Full-Physics"

This package implements "alternate" or "augmented" variations of the 
OCO-2 "Full-Physics" forward model and the associated L2 Retrieval.

This is a work in progress, so do not expect the code to be stable 
in any way.

This requires the RtRetrievalFramework (also know as the "Full-Physics" 
forward model) from NASA JPL to be installed beforehand, with the 
python SWIG wrappers included in the build. See [https://github.com/nasa/RtRetrievalFramework](https://github.com/nasa/RtRetrievalFramework)
